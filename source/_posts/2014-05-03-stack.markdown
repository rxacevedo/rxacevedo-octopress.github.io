From time to time, I like to try my hand at writing common data strucutures,
sorting algorithms, etc, just to prove to myself that I can do it. I'm going to
start posting these on here as I go along, in case they're of use to anyone
else. I'll start with a really simple one - the Stack. If you spot something that's
incorrect, please leave a comment.

{% include_code java/Stack.java %}
